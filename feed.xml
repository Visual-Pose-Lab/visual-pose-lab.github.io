To our best knowledge, we are the first to present a finegained and adaptive body representation to sufficiently encode the pose information and effectively build up the relation between the human instance and keypoints in a single-forward pass.</li> <li>Based on the novel representation, we exploit a compact single-stage differentiable network, termed as AdaptivePose. Specifically, we introduce a novel Part Perception Module to perceive the human parts by regressing seven human-part related points. By manipulating human-part related points, we further propose the Enhanced Centeraware Branch to more precisely perceive the human center and the Two-hop Regression Branch together with the Skeleton-Aware Regression Loss to precisely regress the keypoints.</li> <li>Our method significantly simplifies the pipeline of existing multi-person pose estimation methods. The effectiveness is demonstrated on both 2D, 3D pose estimation benchmarks. We achieves the best speed-accuracy tradeoffs without complex refinements and post-processes. Furthermore, extended experiments on CrowdPose and MuPoTS-3D clearly verify the generalizability on crowd and 3D scenes.</li> </ul> <h2 id="body-representation">Body Representation</h2> <p>$C_{inst} → {P_{head}, P_{sho}, P_{la}, P_{ra}, P_{hip}, P_{ll}, P_{rl}} → \bf{Joint}$</p> <h3 id="features">Features</h3> <ul> <li>points are predicted by center feature dynamically and <strong>not pre-defined locations</strong></li> <li>instead of only using the root feature to encode the whole pose information, the features of adaptive points are also leveraged to encode keypoint information of different parts more sufficiently</li> <li>built upon the <strong>pixel-wise</strong> keypoint regression framework</li> <li><strong>differentialbe</strong>, without any non-differentiable process</li> </ul> <h2 id="framework">FrameWork</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230731221909-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230731221909-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230731221909-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230731221909.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230801134203-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230801134203-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230801134203-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/attachment/AdaptivePoseFramework20230801134203.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> ]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="paper-reading"/><category term="pose"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[AdaptivePose]]></summary></entry></feed>
